# Snatch-DL Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Interactive Mode RowDoesNotExist Error**
   - Fixed the `get_selected_format` method to handle empty tables and row access errors
   - Added proper error handling and null checks for the table rows
   - Ensured the format selection defaults to "best" when no rows exist or on error

2. **Download Command Not Working**
   - Fixed asyncio event loop handling in the CLI module's download command
   - Ensured proper execution of download commands with flags like `--audio-only` and `--resolution`
   - Improved error handling and recovery when event loop issues occur

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Enhanced config.json validation with automatic directory creation
   - Added robust error handling for missing configuration keys
   - Ensured platform-specific paths are properly handled

4. **Previous Issues Addressed**
   - Fixed duplicate `AudioConversionError` class definition in `manager.py`
   - Fixed incorrect parameter passing to `validate_ffmpeg_installation()`
   - Improved interactive mode with better error handling

## Implementation Details

### AsyncDownloadManager Fixes

The `download_with_options` method in `AsyncDownloadManager` class was fixed to properly handle:

- Audio-only downloads with FFmpeg post-processing
- Resolution-specific downloads with proper format selection
- Error handling for missing dependencies

### Interactive Mode Enhancements

- Added proper error handling for `get_selected_format` method
- Fixed table row access to prevent RowDoesNotExist errors
- Added safe defaults when format selection fails

### Additional Improvements

- Added robust error handling for FFmpeg-related operations
- Created comprehensive verification and test scripts
- Improved configuration management for more reliable operation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Interactive Mode Fix

The critical issue in interactive mode was the `RowDoesNotExist` error in the `get_selected_format` method. The fix adds proper checking and handling:

```python
def get_selected_format(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """Get the selected format ID"""
    table = self.query_one("#format-table")
    
    # Check if table has any rows
    if not table.row_count:
        return "best"
    
    # Check if a row is selected
    if table.cursor_row is not None:
        try:
            # Access the row safely
            return table.get_row_at(table.cursor_row)[1]  # Format ID is in column 1
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error selecting format: {str(e)}")
            return "best"
            
    # Default to best quality if nothing is selected
    return "best"
```

This ensures that:

1. If there are no rows, it defaults to "best" quality
2. It safely attempts to access the selected row with proper exception handling
3. If an exception occurs, it logs the error and defaults to "best" quality

### Download Command Fix

The second critical issue involved the download command not working properly. The fix ensures that async operations are handled correctly:

```python
# Start the download process
try:
    # Use loop.run_until_complete to ensure the download completes
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(self.run_download(urls, options))
    return 0
except RuntimeError:
    # If we can't run directly, fall back to previous method
    self.run_async(self.run_download(urls, options))
    return 0
```

This approach:

1. Attempts to use the current event loop properly
2. Falls back to an alternative method if runtime errors occur
3. Ensures that the download process always completes

### Configuration Enhancement

The configuration handling was improved with robust validation and directory creation:

```python
def validate_config(config):
    """Validate configuration and create any missing directories"""
    required_dirs = [
        "video_output",
        "audio_output",
        "sessions_dir",
        "cache_dir"
    ]
    
    # Check and create required directories
    for dir_key in required_dirs:
        if dir_key in config:
            directory = config[dir_key]
            if not os.path.exists(directory):
                os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)
```

This ensures that all required directories exist before the application attempts to use them.

### Fix Management Scripts

The fixes are organized into multiple scripts:

1. `apply_all_fixes.py` - The main script that applies all fixes in sequence
2. `direct_fix.py` - Uses regex to directly patch the affected code
3. `fix_interactive_mode.py` - Focuses specifically on fixing the interactive mode
4. `ensure_config.py` - Ensures proper configuration setup

These scripts can be run independently or in sequence through the main `apply_all_fixes.py` script.

## Testing Approach

Created several test scripts:

1. `test_audio_and_resolution.py` - Tests audio-only and resolution downloads
2. `apply_all_fixes.py` - Applies all fixes in the correct sequence
3. `direct_fix.py` - Provides direct fixes to the critical issues
4. `fix_interactive_mode.py` - Specifically fixes the interactive mode issues
5. `ensure_config.py` - Ensures configuration is properly set up

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

1. More comprehensive progress reporting
2. Better error messaging for end users
3. Improved dependency validation at startup
4. More robust event loop handling for asyncio operations

## Usage Instructions

- For audio downloads: `snatch download --audio-only URL`
- For video at specific resolution: `snatch download --resolution 720 URL`
- For interactive mode: `snatch interactive`
- For comprehensive fixes: `python apply_all_fixes.py`
