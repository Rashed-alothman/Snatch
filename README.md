## Usage

### Basic Examples

1. Start the App and Enter URLs Interactively:

   - Launch using:
     ```
     python Snatch.py
     ```
   - [Insert your interactive mode banner image here]
   - In interactive mode, simply paste a URL to download in best quality.

2. Quick Commands (Direct Execution):
   - You can also download without entering interactive mode. Just run:
     ```
     python Snatch.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example"
     ```
   - To download in a specific format or video quality, append the keyword or number:
     - For audio as MP3:
       ```
       python Snatch.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" mp3
       ```
     - For high-quality FLAC audio:
       ```
       python Snatch.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" flac
       ```
     - For a specific video resolution (e.g., 1080p):
       ```
       python Snatch.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" 1080
       ```

### Advanced Usage

  - URL followed by a resolution (720, 1080, 2160) â†’ Downloads video in that quality.
